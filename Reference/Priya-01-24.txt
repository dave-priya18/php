Difference between Array Functions:


1. arsort() v/s rsort()
	
	arsort() - index association in reverse & doesn't change the indexing

	rsort() - value association in reverse & reindex with the ordering

2. array_search() v/s in_array()

	array_search() - returns correspondent key if value exists

	in_array() - returns boolean True/False if value exists/ doesn't exist

3. array_map() v/s array_walk()
	
	array_map() - doesn't concern about internal pointer of array; walk through every data eventually
				- doesn't change the actual state of data

	array_walk()- works as foreach loop
				- change the actual state of data
